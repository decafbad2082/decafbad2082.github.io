                    <div class="comment"> is AGP (autogynephila) a valid sexuality/identity, or is it just a fetish? Reading threads here, some feel it from a young age, even prior to any porn. There are guys/girls in the public eye that express it as their way of being (e.g. Ashley Barron, f1nn5ter); but I know critics will say anyone trooning out from AGP is a fraud and not dysphoric. Your thoughts? </div>

He's partnered with the company that runs the server and the pay-to-win shop. In each youtube video he buys some of the pay to win stuff and \"miraculously\" gets exactly the item he needed to accomplish whatever he was doing in that video. It's kinda equivalent to a casino owner playing his own slot machine and winning all the time, but when the regular gamblers play the same machine they get fucked. 4423298 Anonymous 10 Feb 2022 23:24:42    >>24422954 only the brainwormed think about shoulders. man look pretty face man want to cum on that face, simple as. 4423299 Anonymous 10 Feb 2022 23:24:42    >>24423088 yes the scamming part is easy enough, but how this fits in with minecraft isn't. like how would you prove that he has \"enhanced\" drop rates for these items. pretty sure the server runs some proprietary code. and even if you had access to the actual drop rates, he could still just be insanely lucky.  what i'm trying to say is, it doesn't matter if it's legal or not, he's not gonna be prosecuted for it 4423352 Anonymous 10 Feb 2022 23:28:49    >>24423299 >it doesn't matter if it's legal or not, he's not gonna be prosecuted for it no, definitely not. there's tons of other minecraft youtubers that do the exact same thing. 4423371 Anonymous 10 Feb 2022 23:30:16    >>24422851 Maybe with the right angle, lighting and poses.

On the other hand you can just be a \"normal\" guy but if you look/act feminine people might call you a femboy. >i don't take hrt That's not a requirement of being a femboy but it is preferred. >it feels fetishy, doesn't it?

You need to be born with an inherent amount of natural androgyny to be feminine as a male. The make-up and girly clothing does require effort, but it's pointless without that physical androgyny. 4407511 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 20:04:21 1644092555118.jpg   >>24404231 >it feels fetishy, doesn't it? It doesn't have to be inherently sexual, but historical trends have men wearing feminine attire for mostly sexual satisfaction. It's hard to separate opinions from that. Most of the public has come to accept femboys, but they will see a qt boy in make-up and a skirt as sexualizing himself. 4407520 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 20:05:22    >>24406083 His Dad is bald as fuck, so he's gonna have to really consider HRT at some point.

I verified this by asking him one day if he was \"like, a femboy or something.\" He's pretty short and feminine in voice and mannerisms. The question seemed to amuse him, since (according to him) no one had ever asked him that before. He mulled over it a bit, and decided that he was a femboy. He mentioned that he wears some women's clothes since men's clothes rarely come in a size that fits him. For example, he said he owns women's jeans for this reason, and also because he's \"slim thick\" (his words, not mine, but he did retract them as being a joke). I told him I thought femboys were cute, and that I thought it was cute that he wore women's clothes. That also seemed to amuse him. I really do NOT want to fuck this up for myself. I get the feeling the interest may not be reciprocated, though. I gave him my number the other night, so we'll see.

I have nothing against either femboys or trans people, but the amount of cognitive dissonance is kind of stupid. 4358071 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 05:13:05    >femgen >fem >nothing but drama come on... 4358241 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 05:28:50    >>24352485 Add the SHAFE survey Survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tkq5zfVWYfcT6EOLwyxiUK5ipxr4kxvcDFlvWvZtP8Q/ Results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZKskD7hy4VlV5uKlxmuqdftpv8oTSkgAy9iG3Qw7zj0/  4358463 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 05:44:32    >>24353340 >>24353448 how is this a femboy? just a good looking guy 4358650 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 06:03:29    >>24358463 Not a femboy. 4358660 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 06:04:29 6C092CC6-386E-47E3-9A49-95E82C6C (...).jpg   >>24353141 hmm 4358783 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 06:17:03    >>24358660 It’s just a matter of time until we see them “collaborating.” 4359212 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 07:06:45    >>24355861 >>24358783 Finn is taller, so he’s the top 4359759 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 08:08:39 738DA9F0-927B-413D-BA72-E2DC755F (...).jpg  Well….

Get the fuck out of my house!? >That's a shitty metaphor but you get the idea. >>We ( finn and me ) gave you this opportunity to actually have meaningfull conversations, a foot in the door, and you did fuck all with it. >Does that make you sad? What were you expecting? I don't know what to say to Finn, I don't even really care that much, I find Finn interesting more than anything else. I like studying body language and Finn poses the perfect way for me to do that. >Let's say you love ice cream and you come across a streamer that streams creating different ice cream flavours, you're going to watch for the content of the streams more than the streamer itself, right? >That's kinda how I feel with Finn, although I like him as a person I don't really care if you know what I mean. I find him attractive but there's not much else to it, his actions and his lies are more entertaining to me than the guy himself.  4398654 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 02:48:59    >>24398628 without exaggeration Finn has more feminine body language than most women I know 4398669 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 02:50:05    >>24398654 and trans women 4398674 JohnKeiwo 09 Feb 2022 02:50:21    >>24398611 You overestimate the extent of what my \" relation \" to finn is. How many times did I tell u that he aint anything close to my friend ? We act friendly but like we don't talk unless it's stream related, he doesn't ask what I did in my day as I don't ask or don't care what he does in his unless it's streaming. He is just a content creator who I mod for dude, and that's it, I'm a nobody and in 2 years he would have forgotten who I am like wtf do u want ? Do u want me to tell u I wrote a fanfiction or some delusional shit ? Nah bro, we aint friends, never gonna meet or some shit, like it's just ultra weird that u folks have this perception, me sending money, me sending clothes doesn't constitute a relationship, it's content. U can't buy friendship it's a childish way to see shit 4398694 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 02:51:40    >>24398628 Interesting. I think I would enjoy having the chance to have an unfiltered conversation with him. He probably still wouldn't be completely honest though, even in a setting like that. 4398711 JohnKeiwo 09 Feb 2022 02:53:20    >>24398628 Yeah and like I said, this attitude just reafirms my belief that youa ctually enjoy the gossip more than having actual answers, don't get pissy, it's just how it is. Because it's fun for you so I get it. And like he said on stream he just finds it weird how invested folks are into it, he gets it to an extent but u gotta admit it's obsessive, especially hijacking every thread over and over. 4398735 JohnKeiwo 09 Feb 2022 02:55:03    >>24398694 Welp too bad, he said they could go throught me if they wanted to talk, haven't recieved anything from them since, he wanted to fact check the theories or debunk them but nothing came out of it. But my own belief is that since the mystery is more interesting than the real answers, any answer that people don't deem satisfying enough, they will dismiss as a lie or any form of deflection 4398744 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 02:55:29    >>24398711 i used to be fond of you but you've gotten so reflexively defensive that i have to assume some bad shit is happening in your real life 4398762 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 02:56:44    >>24398744 dude's suicidal 4398777 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 02:57:45    >>24398711 >u gotta admit it's obsessive, especially hijacking every thread over and over. take a long hard look at youself 4398783 Anonymous 09 Feb 2022 02:58:04    >>24398735 I'll just DM him on twitter and say I'm the hacker known as 4chan. 4398788 JohnKeiwo 09 Feb 2022 02:58:21    >>24398744 U were never found of me stop the bullshit, it's just that I spoke the same language as you for a time, my views on 4chan have never changed, I'm always defensive, it's a reflex, also it's good to change things up, if I'm always friendly to you people it gets boring af, we need some antaginising, we need some drama ya know.

At least with pooners you can kinda tell they just have different bone structure if you aren't blind, how are you supposed to notice something vague like fat distribution?

That and being actually misogynistic or not wanting to be a victim of misogyny. Summed up byt this post  >>24358776 . (self-explanatory) If you were not actually trans (which doesn't mean just identify as a woman) you wouldn't have discomfort about features caused by TESTOSTERONE. The simple fact is that pretty feminine features are appreciated more but pretty feminine WOMEN are also treated like subhumans. And transwomen are treated as even lower than that, freakish men that rejected their natural state to attempt being a woman, as in a complete reject that attempts to give up their masculine status to become a lesser human, while also having absolutely no advantages from being femininely attractive. Have you not seen the blackpilled transwomen that realize that their \"transition\" was a vain effort, and thus just identify as men. They are probably more masculine that some femboys are, thus these femboys are able to be more comfortable in this \"feminine male\" state than the failed transwomen. Also, some dysphoric people are simply more dysphoric that others, it's not set in stone that if one is dysphoric about some parts, then they must be a 100% wants to be a curvy 50s housewife type of female. Women age to either become hags, or basically older, wrinklier versions of themselves, see for instance Jennifer Lopez or whatever.  Men age to become more masculine, as is the nature of testosterone. Men who look feminine in youth will lose that. To against that is to be dysphoric about being MALE. No ifs or buts. Just lmfao at \"femboys\" who project a feminine image online, but irl look like the product of their biology that they are. Picrelated.  Femboy is cope, hrt femboys are trannies who are misogynistic ie. they hate women and treat them as lesser humans. 4361886 Anonymous 06 Feb 2022 13:18:54 1643979298495.png   >>24361838 To add - being a boy means you will become a man.

Yeah right, testosterone will literally foil all your plans, you will only end up more and more depressed as every day your looks will vanish leaving in place an angular manly square face. I think you need to get real and stop living in dreamland, it will turn into a literal nightmare. 4307666 Anonymous 02 Feb 2022 21:44:41    >>24307270 I don't really want to fully transition, but while I'm in my 20s I'd like to be able to crossdress and take cute pictures without being too glaringly obvious that I'm a man. 4307870 Anonymous 02 Feb 2022 21:57:09    >>24306906 Okay so you wanna know? You really wanna know? Too bad it is a closely guarded secret of all femboys. Anyways, skincare varies depending on your face and your complexion. Whether you moisturize will depend on your type of complexion but that is really the only step that will change. Step 1: Rinse face with cold water, iced if you can. Step 2. Use a good brand of facial soap. Lather, and rinse. Step 3. Use a liquid face peel (Body Shop has drops of youth brand and I like that aside from price) Step 4. Use a non-alcohol based toner (Tea Tree oil toners are nice) Step 5. Utilize a neutral face moisturizer if your skin calls for it. Diet: Reduce meat for the most part. Lean towards plant based proteins though. You'll want a high fiber high protein diet to build a lean muscle and help with caloric metabolization.  Exercise: Cardio is good, and weighted squats will help with building mass around the thigh and glute area. 4307902 Anonymous 02 Feb 2022 21:59:03    >>24307270 >leaving in place an angular manly square face. Bone growth (side from the spine) is literally done by the early 20s. If someone is androgynous at 22, they're going to remain with that same facial skeleton shape their entire life. Aging is loss of muscle tone and skin elasticity.  It's amazing how much you trannies obsess over your appearance but lack knowledge of basic anatomy.  >>24306906 To answer you question, OP. The general exercise routine is going to be moderate intensity cardio with the occasional resistance (e.g. hills) to improve the lower body muscles. You can add on core-base mobility exercises too. 4307917 Anonymous 02 Feb 2022 22:00:08    >>24306906 eat healthy, cardio excercise, avoid sun, do skincare 4308116 Anonymous 02 Feb 2022 22:12:29    >>24306906 can someone give a retard proof explaination for how a socially retarded cis femboy bottom (me) can get a prescription for this?  > https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jkbzul/all_of_my_custom_compounds_are_now_available/ what are you even supposed to ask/tell a doctor, just hand him a reddit url and ask for his signature? 4308185 Anonymous 02 Feb 2022 22:17:29    >>24307666 >being too glaringly obvious that I'm a man.

This whole thing kind of lost its magic as soon as Finn joined the discord, I feel like a kid at home doing his homework except the teacher is in my house standing over my shoulder watching me do it, like fuck off I was fine doing my homework without you watching me, now I just feel uncomfortable, you're gonna see my work anyway, you don't need to be here... Get the fuck out of my house!? That's a shitty metaphor but you get the idea. 4336275 JohnKeiwo 04 Feb 2022 19:19:08    >>24336141 Why don't u say that to him directly =) ? Or just straight up kick him out of the discord ? We ( finn and me ) gave you this opportunity to actually have meaningfull conversations, a foot in the door, and you did fuck all with it. I don't dislike you when I say this but it feels .. limp dicky ? Maybe you start seeing things like I do, finn is a human that you might not find that entertaining or \" magical \" once you know too much or just have the opportunity to actually know, what you enjoy is the thrill of the speculation but not the possibility of getting an answer, I get it, it's fun to make theories. Oh and I know he hasn't popped in there but you haven't been talking to him, he never initiates convos. 4336390 Anonymous 04 Feb 2022 19:27:49    >>24336275 I assumed that Finn joined the discord just to get a sense of what was going on in these threads.

Does that make you sad? What were you expecting? I don't know what to say to Finn, I don't even really care that much, I find Finn interesting more than anything else. I like studying body language and Finn poses the perfect way for me to do that. Let's say you love ice cream and you come across a streamer that streams creating different ice cream flavours, you're going to watch for the content of the streams more than the streamer itself, right? That's kinda how I feel with Finn, although I like him as a person I don't really care if you know what I mean. I find him attractive but there's not much else to it, his actions and his lies are more entertaining to me than the guy himself. >once you know too much or just have the opportunity to actually know, what you enjoy is the thrill of the speculation but not the possibility of getting an answer Not false. 4337546 Anonymous 04 Feb 2022 21:07:04 1637351567341.jpg  4338017 Anonymous 04 Feb 2022 21:43:08    >>24335700 Thicc thighs save lives 4338054 Anonymous 04 Feb 2022 21:45:10    >>24335700 blessed 4338118 Anonymous 04 Feb 2022 21:49:51    >>24337541 >Does that make you sad?

Regardless, a femboy is a short, slim, and smooth naturally androgynous male that enjoys light feminine attire. They don't want to actually be women and use male pronouns. It's analogous to tomboys. A gender description that is purposefully removed from transgenderism to allow cis people to be androgynous.  Whether or not Estrogen meets the femboy criteria is very debatable, but being naturally androgynous is not. A femboy must be a femboy purely by genetics. Any masc dude that takes estrogen to be more feminine is trans. 4252110 Anonymous 30 Jan 2022 01:07:41 __kirisame_marisa_touhou_drawn_b (...).jpg   >>24251289 a femboy is an amab who still identifies as an amab, but prefers to express themselves in a predominantly feminine manner. this may or may not be joined by symptoms of dysphoria, and the boy may or may not be on hrt or taking other actions to feminines themselves further. femboys are a form of nonbinary expression.

I missed these early streams and only know content from the last half year or so. What's worth going back to and watching? Any classic streams?  I hope we can get finn back to this mentality somehow, instead of upping the slut level. And despite John saying it's worthwhile content, I'm confident the majority of his fans are there for Just Chatting, not MC. I don't mean slutting out, I mean talking and entertaining viewers rather than mostly talking about his current Minecraft build. That's what we want, not just sexual content. 4209132 Anonymous 27 Jan 2022 02:41:59    >>24209069 >What's worth going back to and watching? Any classic streams? I'd say anything from 2020 and maybe early 2021 is good. Don't count on Finn getting back in that mindset though. Those streams are a product of the circumstances. Finn was new to streaming, new to crossdressing, still living with his parents, and his behavior reflected that. It's just not possible for him to be that person again now that he is more comfortable as a streamer and a sissy slut. >I'm confident the majority of his fans are there for Just Chatting, not MC I completely agree here. There is not much crossover between his Youtube minecraft audience and his streaming audience. 4209158 Anonymous 27 Jan 2022 02:45:32    >>24209132 I found it amusing when he played dumb about sissy shit the other day when he'd already talked to riza about it on her stream 4209185 Anonymous 27 Jan 2022 02:48:09    >>24206053 If you re-watch his initial reaction, I don't think he's a good enough actor to pull that off. 4209211 Anonymous 27 Jan 2022 02:50:17    >>24209158 He can be actually dumb at times, but he plays dumb as if he had the memory of a goldfish.

He's creative, pretty smart with building things, and clearly loves the game. The videos also clearly 200k viewers pretty easily.  Twitch has, obviously, become a service for horny simps wanting their parasocialization. It makes sense his viewership would go down on Twitch with the Mincecraft stuff, but there is good Youtube money to be made with this many viewers on every video.

Also, the people complaining are such a small fraction of the fandom, so many people move on and you will too.

He's not like exceptionally good at pvp, he's not a speedrunner, and being \"good\" at the shit he does play boils down to him using the pay2win shop and miraculously getting exactly what he needed in each video. 4131755 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 19:42:18 845376.png   >>24131518 >I guess the prestige of being a top MC celebrity is too alluring.

In practice many similiar words can be used interchangeably, even though they have slightly dissimiliar meanings. for instance, a 'twink' and a 'femmeboy' mean precisely the same thing, but a trap is specifically a effeminate crossdressing boy, especially one for whom it is not immediately obvious what their biological sex is and can 'pass' as a female so to speak without much scrutiny. 4124797 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 07:12:28    >>24124765 That's just a beta straight thing, we omega straight 4124807 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 07:13:13    >>24124758 call it whatever the hell you want, your still having sex in exchange for money. 4124820 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 07:14:14    >>24124759 if your fucking guys up the ass and dressing up little boys in maids outfits, how straight can you be? the money is incedental; there are easier ways to make money. 4124841 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 07:16:18    >>24124795 >femmeboy and twink mean precisely the same thing not necessarily. a femmeboy could theoretic be straight or bisexual, a twink is specificly gay or bisexual. 4124850 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 07:17:19    >>24124841 >a femmeboy could theoretic be straight lol, yeah, in your dreams. 4124861 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 07:18:44    >>24124820 dommes are rarely into their subs, they get off the power and money, well most of them 4124882 Anonymous 21 Jan 2022 07:20:26    >>24124841 a twink can just describe someones appearance and body type too, it doesn't necessarily connonate your sexual identity. things were so much easier when we would just hand them over to the church and have horny priests sort them out and make them sing soprano.

There’s a pretty clear distinction imo, traps are guys that look like girls, while femboys are feminine, but still clearly are men and aren’t trying to present otherwise 4112072 Anonymous 20 Jan 2022 14:47:23    >>24112000 >while femboys are feminine See, that's the issue. Some people think that shaving their legs, or wearing tight clothing is feminine enough to qualify. I think that femboys should at least have some basic feminine body and facial features. As a rule of thumb less than 1% of the young male population should be able to qualify. 4112077 Anonymous 20 Jan 2022 14:47:51    >>24111640 You're not dumb.

Agreed, if he dropped his Minecraft channel or at least put it to the side and made it his hobby rather than his \"main job\" he could genuinely become a top streamer. He'd just need to be consistent, he's got the looks and the charisma and a base audience already, he's literally got everything he needs to make it work.

The thing that trannies like to ignore is that femboy facial features are universally attractive. Even as the feminity fades, you're still going to have high cheek bones, upturned eyes, and a tapered chin. Men don't turn into fat, hairy, ugly bastards at 30 if they were smol pretty boys all their 20s. Just avoid binge drinking, eat well, exercise to stay slim, and avoid dying your hair.

It is a phytoestrogenic essential oil which acts as a natural anti-androgen all in one. A drop on each armpit or less is a good starting dose, I used it in alcohol personally. (1-2 tsp in 25 oz isopropyl alcohol in spray bottle stored in dark cabinet) It works a bit slow, so you'll notice mood and skin changes before the fat redistribution starts to happen. Also look into natural methods of increasing your Aromatase levels. Or listen to the howling haters who don't want you to find out if Tea Tree actually works or not. Also, avoid drinking tea tree oil, it's basically tidepods if you drink it, you'll regret it horribly. 4061522 Anonymous 17 Jan 2022 05:27:55    >>24061443 I don't have no money, I have little money and I'd rather it go to hormones than blood tests if possible. 4061561 Anonymous 17 Jan 2022 05:31:59    >>24061443 >>24061522 That minor correction aside, my suggestion stands. Tea Tree oil is cheaper than even the shadiest bathtub juice you could ever buy raws for, and it also prevents mold. Very effective deodorant, with interesting beneficial side effects. Avoid using so much that you get rejection rash, keep the doses low, it's powerful. 4061607 Anonymous 17 Jan 2022 05:36:51    >>24061522 Some planned Parenthoods do blood testing.

Yeah It's right after that clip, and then after the fake punch Finn gets all sheepish and runs back to his chair and sits down, which makes me think he's conscious of the fact he just flinched on camera and then had a fake punch thrown towards him and he knows people are going to take that clip and talk about it. Again, I'd just like to reiterate that I'm not suggesting any kind of foul play, I just find it fun to analyse body language. >>24036295 She's trans. 4036359 Anonymous 15 Jan 2022 17:50:51    >>24036160 Then post name of this femboy if it is femboy which its not  faggot 4036406 Anonymous 15 Jan 2022 17:55:13    >>24036160 There's nothing to talk about bitches who only post a pic or two per month on their whoring pages.

In fact it is femininity that is valued and even sexualized, men see that and find an avenue to gain recognition, thats just my thought 3960782 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 15:27:50    >>23960705 first guys tummy is digusting 3960809 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 15:30:59    >>23960765 >masculinity is not valued in society I agree for most of society, but there are niche groups that worship masculinity (/fit/ for example) Just like there are groups that worship femininity, I think it's deeper than that. >femininity that is valued and even sexualized, men see that and find an avenue to gain recognition I don't disagree with this but I don't feel it is the main cause. 3960855 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 15:35:52    >>23960705 I need a tutorial on how to get a femboy, I can't stand another nighting looking at pictures on an empty bed, I need to cuddle with one.

These in the pictures are traps, femboys who wear girly clothing and pass as girls but due to trannies getting pissy about the word \"trap\" these ones just get labeled as femboys.  You can't be a femboy unless you look cute and girly. They can still act and dress like a regular boy but they are naturally girly.  I guess dudes just realized they can thot just as good as girls if they put on a skirt and a little make up. 3961008 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 15:49:32    >>23960905 /thread - They found the cash cow. 3961746 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 16:58:02    >>23960905 >drain money out of lonely people Speaking of... has anyone checked out Freddi's onlyfans yet?

My idea of a femboy was someone who looked still like a guy, but had a lot of fem or androgynous features, like a very femmy twink. But all the pics of femboys on this board literally just look exactly like trans people with no identifiable male features other than cock. I'm very confused about what this label is, and if it is the ladder, what would the former be called? 3962119 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 17:29:07    >>23962099 >My idea of a femboy was someone who looked still like a guy, but had a lot of fem or androgynous features, like a very femmy twink +1 F1nn, Fr3ddi and Rynali are just crossdressers in my eyes 3962172 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 17:34:10 Ehvy4R9XkAAvo1g-low_res.jpg   >>23961967 Oh noes 3962198 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 17:36:42    >>23962099 >>23962119 Finn looks and acts fem even when he isn't crossdressing, but Freddi and Rynali are just crossdressers. I feel like the internet has broadened the term femboy recently to encompass any guy that looks feminine, even up to the point of being indistinguishable from a trans woman. 3962480 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 18:00:11 20211218_055056.jpg   >>23960705 >What makes a femboy a femboy? It all depends on what a femboy is to you. For example, if we take tip pics you posted as the meaning of being a femboy then its a boy who's fem presenting. (Female clothes, makeup, etc) this essentially makes them mellowed down crossdressers. The difference being that crossdressers do extreme (and expensive) things to pass better. Ideally they're between the ages of 13 to 25. A proper lifestyle could possibly extend it but not by a lot. They usually end up becoming full on crossdressers or just flat out stopping the whole femboy thing. There's also how a lot of other people see femboys. A guy who looks like a girl even when male presenting or \"male failing\". They're usually intersex males but most of the time they take hrt to achieve that level of feminity. They're essentially boymoders but they voluntarily stay in boymode and turn it into its own aesthetic. They can last longer than cis femboys but a lot of times they troon out completely. But if one can keep boobs to a minimum, maintain a andro face with either good genetics or ffs, then you essentially have a femboy. >Do femboys exist in real life and not just on the internet? Depends on the ones I stated. Cis femboys usually only exist online since dressing up is what makes them a femboy. It's kinda hard to be taken seriously while wearing that kind of stuff irl to work or school. Some do but are usually just seen as really gay people, weebs, or crossdressers, regardless if they want to be associated with that or not. As for the boymoding femboys, they exist but are very hard to find since they usually stay inside. Unironically, your best bet would be to look on discord or here since those are the only two places they exist. 3962484 Anonymous 10 Jan 2022 18:00:38    >>23962119 >F1nn, Fr3ddi and Rynali are just crossdressers in my eyes >F1nn Faggot who looks good in drag, nothing more. >Fr3ddi Faggot who looks awful in drag but somehow still gets attention for it. >Rynali Faggot who actually maybe repressing trans.

Unless you're in it for the money like F1NN5TER it just seems like a weird lifestyle choice to make. 3974912 Anonymous 11 Jan 2022 14:12:32    >>23974821 >I get the attraction to them but I couldn't imagine being one That's because we are chad alphas and they are submissive sissies 3975039 Anonymous 11 Jan 2022 14:28:09   I guess i'd have to make sure my son eats at least one whole sheep's carcass a month, on top of attending some martial arts lessons, to make sure he doesn't turn out a sissy.

Is femboy part of the trans spectrum? Anyone who is uncomfortable with masculinity is on the trans spectrum.  >2. Is femboy part of the gay spectrum? If they have a genuine attraction to men yes, otherwise no. 3. Is femboy a sissy? A sissy means acting girly not so much looking like a girl. Some femboys are sissies.  4. Is femboy a twink? A twink is a slender young male. Most femboys are twinks. 5. Is femboy a trap? No. A trap means a trans person who does not want to havd a sex change, like shemales. Femboys do not try to pass as female.  6. Is femboy required to take hormone No. They often do because a real femboy would rather compromise his sex drive to keep looking femme and not go bald. Femboys often want electrolysis and most will take HRT to avoid further masculination. 3977465 Anonymous 11 Jan 2022 17:45:06    >>23977279 I love when he doesn't have makeup on and you can see little blemishes on his face.

Is femboy part of the trans spectrum? Femboys can probably be considered transvestites who look young & attractive and pass as young females, but are wholly males without question >2. Is femboy part of the gay spectrum? Only if you like them if you're a guy and if they like you. Plenty of femboys still just date girls and girls still like them. See: Kpopstars >3. Is femboy a sissy? If he gets off to crossdressing, yes. Otherwise, if he just likes wearing makeup, doing his hair, and wearing lady clothing for non sexual reasons, then no >4. Is femboy a twink? No. It's slightly a nudge over the edge since, Femboys want to appear FEMININE. Twinks are still masc  >5. Is femboy a trap? Ultimately yes if he tricks people into thinking he's a passing girl, which is sort of the point. However, he's supposed to correct them >6. Is femboy required to take hormones? No. In fact, a Femboy who takes hormones is no longer a boy, but instead a eunuch, since he's chemically castrated himself and his sexual function has become defunct. A femBOY is au naturale and never mutilates his sexual function in order to remain a functional male. Troons will disagree because femboys are superior and are the real reason they 41% :) eat shit. 3989088 Anonymous 12 Jan 2022 14:11:21    >>23988529 >he used to be entertaining with it, now it's just - \"give me $1000 and I'll do the same thing I do every other stream\" sounds about right  >It's not fair to just blame Finn though yes. in a way the audience is to blame for everything that went wrong. he's just doing the bare minimum to satisfy them. lazy zoomer. but people still eat it up and any critique is met with the \"be happy you're getting content at all\" 3989171 Anonymous 12 Jan 2022 14:21:57   We don't need girls.

And since the threads were just ( i'm sorry to say it ) a couple dudes circle jerking over the femboy and not actually providing huge infos on it, they decide it's not worth it and just clap them !

I don't necessarily think that theory is true, It's not really a good enough reason to delete the threads and if they want the threads to reveal things about Finn surely the best play would be to keep them up. I mean who knows, there's still time for things to get revealed here, were the only one's who are actually analysing thing's that are said on stream and creating discussion around him, if thing's are going to be discovered/revealed it's going to happen in these threads.  There could even be theories created here that would force him to have to come out as something if they gained enough traction.. 3945412 Anonymous 09 Jan 2022 10:54:18   holy cow all these no-sound GIFs really accentuate the female body language 3945417 Anonymous 09 Jan 2022 10:54:58   I just want f1nn to make an honest woman out of Riza, out in the open, none of this dl bullshit. 3945424 Anonymous 09 Jan 2022 10:55:59    >>23945417 Like it won't be Riza who makes a woman out of F1nn 3945425 Anonymous 09 Jan 2022 10:56:20    >>23945417 I want Riza to make an honest woman out of Finn 3945430 Anonymous 09 Jan 2022 10:56:59    >>23945417 Do you think he's ashamed to be attracted to her?

I get hit on by 10 guys a week. Get ton of a attention. I chat with them. They compliment me non stop and after some days of exchanging and me mentioning, that I don’t give out nudes for free (duh, I am not a charity), they immediately run away. Like what the hell?

Men want to think that they got you to send nudes because you like them, not because they've paid you for them. It ruins their fantasy that you like them as much as they are attracted to you. And if you aren't going to fuck them/date them then they wont invest in you unless they are real horny bastards, in which case they will just go on only fans and pay someone to send customs. 3889581 Anonymous 05 Jan 2022 15:49:25    >>23889536 They twitch stream and pretend they’re not a tranny, that’s not the same thing as asking money for nudes 3889589 Anonymous 05 Jan 2022 15:50:21    >>23889536 If you want money for nudes start an onlyfans 3889591 Anonymous 05 Jan 2022 15:50:28    >>23889536 From what I learned observing a bdp psycho friend who's apparent sole mission in life is to maintain orbiters/simps; you keep them around by teasing them with just a bit less than what they're after in and endless game of hard to get while also making them feel like they get special treatment over each other.

I am not straight up asking ,pay me for nudes‘ Even though that’s the whol point.

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know..\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as he pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3894358 Anonymous 05 Jan 2022 22:25:46    >>23894022 >So why is so much to ask for when I ask for a little gift value of 20$?

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know..\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as he pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3881101 Anonymous 04 Jan 2022 22:46:18    >>23880849 C'mon dude.

I kinda do, and if i were more impatient or a bit more of an asshole that day, i could easily get annoyed by his acting.  Anyway, let's say his manly act was no act, and that the girly side was indeed the act, then somewhere in his brain sits a very curious lump of neurons. One that so perfectly emulates femininity. Almost like a piece of hardware that does what it's designed to do no? If not designed to be feminine, then it certainly emulates the \"different\" hardware rather well. But i won't go with the latter since no one but Finn has programmed his girly side (emulation software) by the fact that he started it himself. That said, if there's only boy hardware in his noggin', to succeed means we have to get him into emulation mode (be \"fully\" Rose). After that comes the \"malware\" injection as input for the emulation. Basically tons of very good, short, explicit, and kinky horny posting (nothing like the bbc copypasta obviously). What qualifies them as good is their ability to synergize with the girly emulation, and NOT be too disruptive, since Rose is the one driving the emulation, providing the (initial) \"momentum\". Like judo, we use Rose's feminine momentum against her. Hand her cute pink little trojan horses that she'd carry indoors. Basically, all horny posts should \"aid\" the emulation. A tall order, next to impossible if we can only deliver the \"packages\" while she's in girl mode. Though, if there's girl hardware in his noggin', success might be had more easily. I don't know.  It would be crazy wild if we could make him wonder (fantasize) about taking dick just from horny posting. 3888571 Anonymous 05 Jan 2022 13:28:49 istockphoto-1342796309-612x612.jpg   >>23888498  3888576 Anonymous 05 Jan 2022 13:30:08    >>23888498 Yes and it's not even good acting, I think he's somewhat given up trying to convince himself that he has any masculinity left. When he bulk bought all those guns I think that was his last hope at trying to be manly, kind of like a mid-life crisis type thing, he wanted to force the manliness back into him by going out and buying a bunch of \"manly\" items.  >It would be crazy wild if we could make him wonder (fantasize) about taking dick just from horny posting. I don't think we'd need to try very hard, I'd bet he's fantasised about taking dick plenty of times. In the end I really don't think we even need to try that hard to convince him that he's really a woman, I think he's done all the hard work himself, we need to be there to support him and push him over the line 3888650 Anonymous 05 Jan 2022 13:45:23    >>23888576 >force the manliness back into him by going out and buying a bunch of \"manly\" items So we just need to buy him a bunch of girly items that he'd actually enjoy engaging with? I think he'd be a tomboy by heart. So a bunch of tomboy yet girly things. But since I've never had female friends nor interacted with women much, I have no clue what that would be though. They don't necessarily have to be \"tinker on stream\" items. Or maybe they should, to make sure he really engages with them. I want us to really tickle the hell out of that girly lump in his brain.

I've been actually taking skin care seriously for about the past 2 years. My boyfriend got me into it. Before, I'd just wash my face and use moisturizer, but now my routine is a bit more involved: 1. Face wash 2. physical exfoliator (1-2x per week) 3. Toner 4. Eye cream (one for AM, one for PM) 5. Serum  6. Moisturizer 7. SPF  8. Occasional masks 9. Occasional chemical exfoliation (not often because I work outside) 3830346 Anonymous 01 Jan 2022 09:47:12 1629379840218.png  I often fantasize about Rose's first interaction with a man. I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know..\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as he pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3830918 Anonymous 01 Jan 2022 11:46:23    >>23825455 Bro, Fr3ddi is by far the manliest of them all F1nn on the other hand is top waifu material 3831038 Anonymous 01 Jan 2022 12:00:46    >>23830918 he is manlier but admits to being bi. he's just coping in a different way 3831061 Anonymous 01 Jan 2022 12:03:58    >>23831038 So a guy can't just be bi? 3831387 Anonymous 01 Jan 2022 12:57:21    >>23829237 Driving a car doesn't mean I want to be an F1 racer. 3831983 Anonymous 01 Jan 2022 14:19:47    >>23823303 He's not, a lot of trans on this board refuse to believe he's just doing this for the money.

Even the girls who he hung out with who pretended to like him were repulsed by his girly figure, he was no man, he was a femboy, the femmest of boys anyone could imagine. From then on and to this day they'd call him \"faggot\", \"sissy\", \"gayboy\". All his 'friends' would never speak to him again, it would be the worst day of his pathetic life.

Emotional, physical, sexual, nothing is off limits. Sometimes I think of pummelling his cute little face into the ground, I dream about punching his stupid face repeatedly until he's an unrecognisable mess, Mariza is tied up, forced to watch and completely helpless as her precious little faggot boyfriend gets his face broken over and over, every time he whimpers my dick gets a little bit harder and I moan with pleasure at Mariza's helpless cries, she's so close she can feel the squirts of blood coming from his busted eye sockets soak her face with every punch. She cries out in German as she doesn't know the English words to express the pain she feels. The only sound you can hear from Finn is muffled groans of pain through his mangled jaw, with each hit his helpless groans get quieter until eventually he doesn't have the strength to make any sound, Mariza at this point can only cry as she watches the light fade from Finns distorted face, a face she once knew to be beautiful, now beyond recognition. >>23752757 Believe whatever you want if it makes you feel better. 3752974 Anonymous 27 Dec 2021 00:34:34    >>23752937 What the fuck is wrong with you? 3753091 Anonymous 27 Dec 2021 00:44:39    >>23752937 that's pretty cringe. i suggest you go find some people into that stuff because you won't here 3753190 Anonymous 27 Dec 2021 00:52:02 294398.jpg   >>23752565 >>23752625 >>23752743 >>23752757 >>23752974 >>23752974 >>23753091 Ok boys let's ignore the weird posts.

Even still, there's a ton of serums that work amazingly on razor burn. I use one that's meant for the bikini area but it works great on the face.  My boyfriend tried everything he possibly could with his ingrown hair issues but he eventually just punted and got laser.

Only moisturizer actually does anything. You're putting useless shit on your face and using a toner to remove the useless shit off your face. Use baby oil, then a drop of tretinoin, then a cheap nivea moisturizer \"facemask\" once a week before bed. That's it. Use whatever moisturizer you want before bed for the rest of the week so your face doesn't dry out and flake off like a lizard man. You won't need exfoliator or cleanser, you can use it up if you want, but tret renders these products redundant. You can get A-Ret from the same online pharmacies as your HRT. Use a fluid moisturizing sunscreen before you apply makeup and go out since now your face will be so cleansed of skin cells that it will be vulnerable to UV. That's how effective it is. If you apply your fancy moisturizer and your face starts flaking, you'll realize how fucking useless your expensive skincare products really are compared to cheap drugstore nivea cream. Use tret long enough and you'll stop needing to use concealer or foundation, which is even better because those products dry out and fuck up your skin in the first place. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqkt9rYtt2Q  3734226 Anonymous 25 Dec 2021 13:42:26   Does tretinoin help with acne?

I often fantasize about Rose's first interaction with a man. I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know..\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as he pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3735476 Anonymous 25 Dec 2021 16:24:20    >>23735228 a scrip for tretinoin* to clarify, oops 3735510 Anonymous 25 Dec 2021 16:29:04    >>23730800 What's he having done there?

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know..\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as he pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3668300 Anonymous 20 Dec 2021 14:25:39    >>23667309 >did anyone watch the insta stream?

We attended the same primary school and often hung out around in the neighborhood park and woods. He didn't show his girly side until puberty, at which point we were at separate high schools. That meant i only ever got to see him around outside of school, like when i was headed to the local street tuck shop or grocer. We were still friends that would often chill at the park during summer afternoons or when either of us was walking their dog. His girly side was really starting to blossom during our teens, though. And as you'd expect, part of my friend group began distancing themselves from him. However, since most of them moved to the neighborhood after me and the twink, me and him had a closer bond and longer history of friendship, so i was \"off the hook\" for choosing not to distance myself. Anyway, me and him kind of had this little tradition where if we met in the park by chance, then we'd stroll to the tuck shop for snacks. He'd always pick some fireball puffs (a variant of cheese puffs), always offering to buy me something, then we'd make our way back to the park bench and do a bit of \"catching up\". Back at the bench, i'd sit on the bench back rest with my feet on the bench seat, and he'd sit on the bench like a proper lady, and i'd tease him about it some. To which he'd laugh and end up resting his head a bit against my knee, which would be at his eye level. I never minded this, because i knew he wasn't getting all that much acceptance at home. About midway through the packet of fireball puffs, his lips was always stained red, and really brought out his feminine allure, which was also when i'd normally start staring. High school eventually ended, and we both moved to separate states for uni/college. The last time i saw him again in person was during the holidays in 2019. 3691269 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 08:31:20    >>23690745 He sounds nice, hope you see him again Anon! 3691636 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 09:16:50 456677.png   >>23688445 Hmmm, I wonder who took the pic. 3691847 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 09:39:53    >>23691636 Does he jingle her balls? 3691850 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 09:39:59    >>23691269 He was a kind person, the sweetest. If he were a girl i'd've probably tried marrying him by now. I know he liked me \"that way\", and if i'm being honest with myself, i like him that way too. Never stopped thinking about him, though. Not even when i went to uni. Been thinking of him ever since i discovered Finn. Had ended it with my gf back in Easter of 2020 when she started becoming distant and moved campuses. Lately i've been thinking of the twink a lot, some nights i even dream about us back in primary school. When i visited my parents for christmas in 2019, i was in the driveway unloading something from the car, and there he was, strolling to the tuck shop, looking cuter than ever, beautiful even. But i was locked in convo with my old man at the time, so could only wave at \"her\" with a slight smile, she was visibly blushing, i could tell. But that's all i could do at the time. Couldn't let my feelings show in front of dad, yet. I could've made up an excuse to go see him at his house before i left, but pussied out for some reason. One day, i promise i will. One day soon. 3691881 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 09:44:04    >>23662256 Holy shit this looks like my childhood friend 3691916 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 09:47:37    >>23691881 Nice try, you still need to get in line 3691922 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 09:48:26    >>23691916 none of the other images made me think it, but that specific one did cortland... why... 3693225 Anonymous 22 Dec 2021 13:04:00 1640178223874.jpg   >>23691916 that'll be a long line 3693830 lunatic-anon 22 Dec 2021 14:12:08 1640182303958.jpg  Bros, why did f1nn say that linux is bad?

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3625191 Anonymous 17 Dec 2021 01:26:48 1639704381741.jpg   >>23625124 >make Minecraft YouTube videos not a strict requirement, but i do appreciate them 3625262 JohnKeiwo 17 Dec 2021 01:32:48    >>23625175 Ok real shit, I'm black and this shit makes me cringe, like my body is physically hurting when I read those pastas. 3625329 Anonymous 17 Dec 2021 01:37:46    >>23625262 Well you better get used to it because the same guy posts it in every thread. 3625505 Anonymous 17 Dec 2021 01:51:35   What makes Finn called a femboy vs like a crossdresser?

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3609770 Anonymous 15 Dec 2021 23:29:25    >>23609753 post the non-cropped version, nao 3609857 Anonymous 15 Dec 2021 23:37:06    >>23609668 This is so weird to me.

Finn as a heavily feminine person at the worst of times probably experienced his fair share of abuse from these \"people\". We know Finn has been feminine and hung around with girls for most if not all of his secondary school life maybe even during primary school aswell. This is purely anecdotal but I know the first time I experienced attraction to another boy was during a \"cubs\" meeting when I was about ~8. This means he was probably repressing his homosexuality since a very young age, going to school in a diverse city and having to deal with the bullying that is found in UK schools probably caused him to repress so hard that he still hasn't accepted himself to this day, hence the dishonesty and lies. from what i read on a quick google, it seems he grew up in one of the safer parts of birmingham. looking at some street view, the entire place looks pretty rundown however. i don't know about the state of cities in bongland, so maybe that's just normal. have to say tho, the few people i saw on street view, did look very \"diverse\", so i'd say this still checks out 3612868 Anonymous 16 Dec 2021 04:13:42 kx7nd9ohgba41.png   >>23612859 does he actually think getting pegged by mariza is perfectly straight? he obviously still wouldn't want to admit it, cause he's desperate to be straight and it would be more than a little sus. might his homosexuality be repressed so deeply, that he actually believes he's straight? like picrel but unironic 3612894 Anonymous 16 Dec 2021 04:17:31    >>23612868 >might his homosexuality be repressed so deeply, that he actually believes he's straight?

He's fully aware of what's going on here and he's nervous because we are hitting the nail. This. He mentioned that specifically because those are the posts from the threads that 'affect' him the most, probably because some of them are true and he's worried that were going to analyse more clips and discover more truths about him that he wanted to remain hidden. If this is true it also means that he's probably going to be more careful with what he says in the future and definitely more careful with his reactions to donos and other things so to try and limit what theories we can come up with.

My opinions varied a lot and for a time I really disliked her but to a point where it was weird even for me and then I kinda pulled myself back and asked myself \" she is not your friend, this is not your relationship, STOP BEING A WEIRDO at being upset at someone who doesn't know you at all. \" . So I moved on from it and entered a \" don't love her, don't hate her phase\". She has times where she can make me laugh and can make me sigh, I said the same on the reddit, she is an aquired taste, some people vibe with her, some don't. When I wanted to die and I was almost gonna act on it and I ended up not doing it, I made a tweet explaining I was ok but needed time, she commented on it when she did not have to, she had never talked to me before, she was not even following me on twitter, she just wished me the best and hope I was ok. And from here I understood what finn told us, Mariza is a very caring person, she doesn't show it much when she is on stream because it's like a performance, but I have no doubt in my mind that finn is in the best of place when she is here. Even more he can destress from the minecraft recording and just chill out when in girl month so she comes at these times and they can hang out. Their relationship is not my business, to me, they are friends until they say otherwise because content creators can be weirded out or change their dynamic because people talk and get ideas and shit. And in general I don't like shipping people I don't know. 3624028 Anonymous 16 Dec 2021 23:45:45    >>23624010 Stay positive anon.

And if so do you think the members have too much influence on Finn in general? I worry that he bases a lot of his choices regarding how he acts and looks based on what they want rather than what he wants and as a follow up, do you think the council has a negative impact on his mental health? I understand if you don't want to answer these questions, I know you have a close relationship to them but I truly appreciate your transparency in your other answers John. Personally I really like Mariza and I think she is great for Finn, they seem to be extremely happy together and I hope the best for them in the future, I'm guilty of creating theories about them here and out of all the shit I've said in these threads the theory about her abusing him is the only one I really regret talking about because I knew in my heart when I was typing it that it wasn't true, I guess I was just looking for a reaction. >>23624127 >Just don't push your fetishes on him or try to influence him.

As members we do not hold as much influence as people think we do, think consult us for ideas or ask us who the stream was or shit like that. There is no fetish shit in that ( of course u gonna say : MASSIVE CAP. ) but that's how it is, way back there was a member I disliked a lot and they had this sort of will, this \" plan \" for finn and I think that what they did, shaped how people see us now. They are no longer here and I will do everything I can to make sure everyone forgets about them and that they can never return again. They messed the group dynamic, the group had become toxic at some point, people were only talking to argue. We support finn in the decisions HE makes, sadly we cannot control the random donator that comes in, throw a few hundreds for finn to perform tricks for them. There was this one person, called dolly, would always come in the stream, drops 500 dollars and ask for finn to tuck and cross his legs, even in an outfit where u could not tell he was tucked or not. THAT right there, that's some fetish freak shit ! I hate that fucko so much and they magically dissapeared when finn mentionned that nowadays, a streamer would often win a charge back case with paypal. And poof vanished, never to be seen again. We have finn's best interests at heart and I understand how it can be seen from an exterior point of view with me and stov constantly nagging him about the RuLeS ! I wanna change shit, but I'm just a mod, I'm not the streamer, so it has to come from him. Also do not worry about my money, If I gift, I have the means, I got lots of presents for my family, I went to the cinema and restaurants with friends, I started baking again, I exercice non stop. I enjoy my life these days :) 3624378 JohnKeiwo 17 Dec 2021 00:16:37    >>23624350 Yeah, that shit is very off putting.

I believe this, sometimes it's difficult for a viewer to see what's really going on behind the scenes and to know the real motives of Mods and donators, we don't see the whole picture most of the time. (although I am still EXTREMELY skeptical of most of you weirdos). Like I said earlier I really appreciate your honesty and transparency in these replies, I think it was well needed to squash some of the more \"out there\" theories and generally I found it very interesting to hear your thoughts on certain things, I hope you recover from whatever procedure you've had in the hospital and I'm glad to hear you're enjoying life recently.  I dont have any other questions right now, I'm going to relax and watch a stream but if you have any questions for me or any other anons I'd be glad to try and answer. I don't mind either way I feel you've done a lot of honest answering and I'd like to give back to show my gratitude. 3624559 Schizo-poster 17 Dec 2021 00:32:50    >>23624535 Jesus, I might have to read that tomorrow mate, I'm too tired for all that tonight. 3624742 JohnKeiwo 17 Dec 2021 00:46:46    >>23624542 No worries, but don't ever feel like you need to tone down the theories they are enjoyable and some could be true, and the skepticism is natural I get it.

Honestly I love when Finn addresses this stuff on stream, even before I posted as Schizo-poster he addressed one of my posts (the one about him substituting English words for American ones) on stream and ever since then I had the itch, I try to make theories that I think would interest Finn and some he might talk about on stream. I do actually have one last question before I go - Finn said you have sent him links to threads and screenshots before, are there any particular posts or threads you remember sending him? Also does he lurk here? I kinda feel like he probably does as much as he denies it. 3624910 Anonymous 17 Dec 2021 01:00:05    >>23624515 Probably an underage doing underage cringe shit?

And the question was \"do you READ the 4chan threads about yourself?\" and he said \"I wish I knew how\" wish you knew how to what? read? He also immediately went very high pitched when answering which is another sign of dishonesty. lastly he says he's been here before and has read through threads that John linked him, so he's been here and read through threads but he couldn't figure out how to use the site?

Perhaps the milder instances of bullying back then spurred his parents into taking that initiative.

This was probably just his parents trying to push him in a more masculine direction while he was young, they will have noticed how naturally feminine he was as a child and wanted to try and 'force' him to become more masc by making him do typically male dominated sports, I wouldn't be surprised if they had him do (or tried at least) other \"masculine\" activities aswell.  >>23595100 >did he play around with mummys knickers when he was a young lad Probably, but who didn't...? 3596874 Schizo-poster 14 Dec 2021 22:10:35 StepOnMeMommy.png  He often talks about how accepting his parents are of what he does - and what he is - and I am truly envious of his relationship with them, not a lot of people have such a healthy family life. As for his sexuality and his blatant denial of it, I think this stemmed mainly from his school life and how he was treated by the other school kids, He went to school in Birmingham, now if anyone here knows Birmingham It is an extremely heavily Muslim city in the UK, It's possible that he went to school in a good area but from what I've seen from his walking streams it looks like his family lived in a very middle class area which would suggest that he went to school with a somewhat decent Muslim and black population, now without getting too political we all know that Muslims aren't the most tolerant of people, which would suggest that while at secondary school with the bullying culture that is prevalent in UK school's anyway I can imagine it is many magnitudes worse in heavily \"diverse\" schools. Finn as a heavily feminine person at the worst of times probably experienced his fair share of abuse from these \"people\". We know Finn has been feminine and hung around with girls for most if not all of his secondary school life maybe even during primary school aswell. This is purely anecdotal but I know the first time I experienced attraction to another boy was during a \"cubs\" meeting when I was about ~8. This means he was probably repressing his homosexuality since a very young age, going to school in a diverse city and having to deal with the bullying that is found in UK schools probably caused him to repress so hard that he still hasn't accepted himself to this day, hence the dishonesty and lies.  I'm not proof reading all that so if it doesn't make much sense then I'm sorry, I'm pretty drunk and this was all off the top of my head. 3596960 Anonymous 14 Dec 2021 22:18:11    >>23596874 >I'm not proof reading all that so if it doesn't make much sense then I'm sorry, I'm pretty drunk and this was all off the top of my head.

I have no womb, I have no ovaries, I have no eggs. I am a homosexual man twisted by drugs and surgery into a crude mockery of nature’s perfection. All the “validation” I get is two-faced and half-hearted. Behind my back people mock me. My parents are disgusted and ashamed of me, my “friends” laugh at my ghoulish appearance behind closed doors. Men are utterly repulsed by me. Thousands of years of evolution have allowed men to sniff out frauds with incredible efficiency. Even trannies who “pass” look uncanny and unnatural to a man. My bone structure is a dead giveaway. And even if I manage to get a drunk guy home with me, he’ll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of my diseased, infected axe wound. I will never be happy. I wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell myself it’s going to be ok, but deep inside I feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush me under the unbearable weight. Eventually it’ll be too much to bear - I’ll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around my neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. My parents will find me, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They’ll bury me with a headstone marked with my birth name, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a man is buried there. My body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of my legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably male. This is my fate. This is what I chose. There is no turning back. 4051922 Anonymous 14 Dec 2021 05:34:08    >>14051899 you're still our uggo 4051951 Schizo-poster 14 Dec 2021 05:42:47    >>14051899 >I wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell myself it’s going to be ok, but deep inside I feel the depression creeping up like a weed Only relateable part of your fake story. 4051975 Anonymous 14 Dec 2021 05:49:00    >>14049362 who 4051977 Anonymous 14 Dec 2021 05:49:25    >>14051922 >>14051951 I was (merely) pretending to be you. 4051981 Anonymous 14 Dec 2021 05:51:07 .png  Is this the thread sisters?

We might also see the successful (cheap and repeatable) practice of creating embryos with just about any source of dna. And if all this happens, then it shouldn't be long (or hard) someone to grow wombs (uterus + placenta + whatever else) in a vat. And if this happens, and jews don't stymy the goy's efforts in this field, then we're looking at potentially industrializing the practice of growing babies in artificial wombs. Which by what i've already stated above, would allow any couple (man+wife, man+femboyWife) to submit their dna for embryo formation, followed by fetus gestation in the artificial womb-organ-in-a-vat thing.  Now couple that with advances hormone tech, and we may see the taboo around dating femboys rapidly dwindle. Why? because women will no longer be the prime ingredient for rearing offspring. Which more trivializes the argument of \"eww he's dating a femboy, they could never have a real family together\", or such classics as \"why would i date a femboy that can't give me any kids\".  >why would jews obstruct the goy's research in artificial womb science? because the jewish financial system forces goy men and women to work well into their early 40's to advance their careers and income to a level that can sustain a family, which for many is just cutting it too close to missing that window of fertility. Science will save that belly in pic rel from pregnancy or C-section scarring. 3563137 Anonymous 12 Dec 2021 10:32:17    >>23563094 jesus christ 3563183 Anonymous 12 Dec 2021 10:39:46    >>23563094 Go outside once in a while 3563199 Anonymous 12 Dec 2021 10:41:53    >>23563094 Mine and Finn's babies will be beautiful, with his good looks and my intelligence they will be unstoppable, capable of achieving true greatness. 3563274 Anonymous 12 Dec 2021 10:56:15 1623096746485.png   >>23562917 >I fear we, the fans who legitimately care about his wellbeing and want the best for him  3563324 Jane 12 Dec 2021 11:05:17    >>23563274 Yeah I cringed a bit reding this, \"the true fans\" eugh.

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3563958 Anonymous 12 Dec 2021 12:53:23 Ej4ZwfAWAAESyJR.jpg   >>23562936 >What are the cultural ramifications of the sudden influx of young guys becoming more feminine?

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3539453 Anonymous 10 Dec 2021 15:09:45 1639148960964.png   >>23539005 >Doing something fun with your favorite femboy?

This guy for example  >>23554280 >That's just your nostalgia keeping yu hostage with your feelings anon, the content was the same I've noticed him in the last few threads saying the same old line, \"Finn has always been like this, you're just nostalgic, he was never wholesome...etc\" We know this to not be true as we have evidence in the form of VOD's so the shilling somewhat seems pointless to me, do you think this is an effort by the council to try and discourage any new people who find these threads? To try and forge their opinions on Finn before they even have a chance to form their own...? They are trying to paint Finn as a slut who has always been a slut and is never going to be wholesome again because he never was wholesome, this is untrue on so many levels and we need to call this behaviour out anytime we see it as to not discourage new Finn enjoyers from seeing the truth. 3555075 Anonymous 11 Dec 2021 20:17:37    >>23554963 >finn's personal glowies invading the thread i think you're on to something... 3555086 Jane 11 Dec 2021 20:18:23    >>23554963 Maybe it's always the same guy, to be a council move?

They're not trying to push people away, they're trying to make sure any new fans share their views and opinions of Finn and don't create their own, they have seen the varying different opinions we all have in these threads and are scared that we might be influencing Finn in ways they don't agree with.

He knows that if it wasn't for the fact that he donated so much money Finn wouldn't want anything to do with him, this is obvious by how Finn and Mariza (mainly Mariza) act when talking about him (there's a clip, I'll link down below) I get the vibe that if Finn could drop ties with Stov tomorrow he would, but it's not as easy as that, they are entwined in each others lives now, note how Finn just sent Stov one of the keys to his box of boy clothes. For Finn to move on from Stov he would require a total rebrand from what he's doing, there's no getting away from him while he's still crossdressing, even if he did block him Stov would just make a new account. I didn't really have a point here I was just spitballing, trying to keep the thread active. >(there's a clip, I'll link down below) When Mariza was joking about fat people on the Germany stream Stov wrote a message in chat something like \"jokes are meant to be funny\" Finn mentions that \"chat\" don't find it funny and Mariza points out (a couple of times) \"look who doesn't find it funny\" pointing at chat and Stov's message, this implies to me that they have (off stream) joked about Stov and his weight issues before.

I agree, I worry that this is also true for a lot of his other viewers aswell though, I can't imagine there are many who look at Finn as much more than a tool for getting sexual pleasure. I fear we, the fans who legitimately care about his wellbeing and want the best for him are in the minority, I guess that just comes with the territory though, when your career is based around you looking good and teasing people in front of a camera you're bound to attract people who are there for that and nothing else. 3562940 Anonymous 12 Dec 2021 09:54:45   New thread >>23562936 >>23562936 >>23562936 ",

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3512520 Jane 08 Dec 2021 19:23:30    >>23512484 Stop it, get some help.

Every story I hear about people's transitions is that they were depressed or suicidal, their dysphoria was crippling them and transitioning helped their mental health. What if my wellbeing is fine, I can manage my dysphoria due to a generally positive outlook and enjoying my pursuits in life. What I'm trying to say is, is my transition 'valid' if being trans isn't a crippling centre point of my life, more of a personal issue (like personal growth issue?) because the rest of my life is pretty well sorted out. The only other thing I can think of is I work in food service but spend most of my time working on art, maybe coz I can fly under the radar in a gender sense y'know I don't have dysphoria knocking on my door every second. If I were in an office where I had to wear suit and tie and answer customer calls maybe I'd be more depressed because dysphoria would be a more constant reminder and then I'd feel like transitioning is a more major part of my life. It does feel like the most important part of my life right now but I'm worried I'm just to nonchalant about the whole thing. I need to transition but more of a 'I need to and no one's gonna stop me' than a 'I need to otherwise I'm gonna neck' end of my rambling >inb4 good for you happyshit genuinely thank you though to anyone who reads this 3508411 Anonymous 08 Dec 2021 13:38:46    >>23504484 Kek 3508434 Anonymous 08 Dec 2021 13:41:43 FAoxFQxXEAonvjy-.jpg   >>23504346 >Mental health I've been daydreaming about sucking his cock for a couple of weeks now.

People can experience very little dysphoria, but instead experience gender euphoria. Do you enjoy presemting as the opposite sex? Do you think you would prefer that over your birth sex? Do you think you might want to live your life that way? That's all that matters. You don't have to be at a low point to transition. Bruce Jenner was a famous and wealthy athlete, she still became Caitlyn. Elliot Page was one of the most famous women in the world. He still transitioned. You don't have to be a depressed loser to want to be the opposite gender. 3508723 Anonymous 08 Dec 2021 14:17:25    >>23508434 You are sane! 3508754 Molly McDolly!!cFfUMiVYF8k 08 Dec 2021 14:21:41   it seems like it's just a running joke for everyone to play with my emotions it's just rly fun to lead me on for a cheap laugh and ruin my day i guess 3508778 Anonymous 08 Dec 2021 14:23:58    >>23508621 It's just the city I live in I think.

Making good friemds is very hard with other transgender persons because they are usually highly sensitive to thier own thought processes.

Was repressing pretty well, but I think that’s just because I had other things to worry about. I’m finally a functioning adult with stability, and now the dysphoria is taking center stage. I work a very dangerous job, so it would be so easy to just have an accident. I had hoped not to transition because of all the difficulties that entails, but I’m starting to come to the conclusion that I probably won’t live very long if I keep on this path. It feels like I’m one bad night away from a gory death. On a more positive note, I think I’d at least pass decently if I do troon out. I’ve got a little bit of square body going on, but I’ve got a baby face and I’m pretty short for a guy. Big boobs run in the family, so I’d have that going for me too. 3511119 Anonymous 08 Dec 2021 17:38:01   My life was already pretty shit but transitioning took away the only good thing I had in it, my long term partner of six years, I don’t think I’m ever going to heal, I’m so incredibly lonely, I’m the closest I’ve been to suicide but I am too cowardly for even that. I almost want to stop hormones just for her but I feel like she’ll never be attracted to me again anyway.

What do you know about strength? Suicide is literally the cowards way out. It's for people who can't handle life and/or the consequences that lead them to the point that they reached in life. It doesn't take strength. Its pure undiluted cowardice and selfishness. I'll never forget the look on my mother's face. The looks of sadness on the police officers faces when I was found covered in blood. Stop being a retard and stop encouraging other people to be a retard.

Me too. When he was talking about having to dodge a cumshot while he was in bed and Mariza jokingly says \"mine?\" Finn says no and that prompts Mariza to ask \"who's?\" why do you think she would ask that if Finn wasn't gay? Who else's cumshot would he be dodging in bed, certainly not a girls because cis girls don't shoot cum, so Mariza shouldn't have had to ask who's cumshot he was dodging as he was obviously talking about his own, unless she knows it's possible that he could have had another man in bed shooting his cum at Finn...

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3482764 Anonymous 06 Dec 2021 17:38:50    >>23482535 >unless she knows it's possible that he could have had another man in bed shooting his cum at Finn...

As for him coming out I think it will be soon just based off the hints we have got recently, he has completely stopped denying he's gay when people joke about it, Riza made so many gay jokes in that last Germany stream that it was pretty obvious she was hinting at something (whether consciously or not). You can only deny something for so long when it's obvious and people keep asking you about it.

His depression was largely due to the mincraft channel grind not producing the results he wanted in a 'timely fashion'. When the channel finally output results that reflected his input, that's when his depression waned, or so i suspect. So for him to neglect and let wither the newfound twitch success, out of purely laziness, despite knowing that depression could arise therefrom, seems strange to me. I know depression, he would keep doing what worked in the past to keep it at bay, which for him seemed to be 'staying on that grind'. The depression stems from the grind not 'paying off', but it is paying off currently, so there should be little reason for the current behavior/laziness, or at least, grind-based depression should not be the reason. Unless it's depression related to something else, but what?  Perhaps the initial circumstances of the twitch crossdressing endeavor were instrumental in subduing his depression, particularly because it let him express himself femininely on 'his terms'. Which has recently not been the case, it's been on 'Girl Month' terms. But why would it trouble him so? Maybe because it doesn't match the type of woman that he feels himself to be. Therefore, the current circumstance might be insufficient in letting him resonate with that woman he feels like inside, \"the pressure valve isn't working correctly\" -so to speak. Is this repression? Perhaps this is the current source of his depression? The cause of his 'laziness'? 3492528 Anonymous 07 Dec 2021 09:33:36   Reading through these threads probably affects his mental health more than anything, Jesus christ. 3492746 Anonymous 07 Dec 2021 10:11:50    >>23492528 Yeah, I got a feeling he started skimming through these threads recently.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing for a content creator to have access to, sometimes you need the honest unfiltered thoughts of your fans, if he just listened to what people say on his Reddit or even worse his twitter replies, he would think he's gods gift to the world, sometimes you need to be grounded and have people tell you how it is, and this is the perfect forum for that. >Stream more, faggot.

Perhaps this is the current source of his depression?

I don't know enough about his Minecraft stuff, especially epic SMP but I do know he associated with a lot of other content creators on there, Minx, Riza, Jschlatt etc.. maybe his depression from the server failing stemmed from not having these same friends to play his favourite game with anymore? Again I really don't know enough about it to comment further than that. >his crossdressing is an expression of the same feelings. as he couldn't keep up with the other minecrafters, he found an alternative source of attention and validation. I can see this too for sure, once he got lucky with that first omegle video blowing up, all the positive emotions and feelings he had from his past successes will have come flooding back, this in turn will have caused him to seek out those same feelings and the attention it brings, also I can imagine constantly getting comments being told how good you look is a massive boost for someone with as low self esteem and as depression prone as Finn is. >so the sadder he gets, the sluttier he becomes, only to then realize what he has done, once he's feeling better; immediately regretting it because it further harms his chances of becoming a successful minecrafter, which is what he actually wants to be I really hope this isn't true for Finn's sake, because if it is then it's not a good place to be for him at all. Only bad things will come from forcing himself to be happy by doing things he doesn't want to.

No one on the server was really that much friends with each other and they promised some big ames that never came, so it died. He just had a lot to do then othing to do in a few weeks, he has lots of people he can talk to, I don't buy the depression right now, before yes but right now I don't think he is that sad in his life but once again like everyone here I'm just a shitter who isn't in his head so you can never know. 3496092 Anonymous 07 Dec 2021 16:53:37    >>23492386 >there should be little reason for the current behavior/laziness, or at least, grind-based depression should not be the reason. Unless it's depression related to something else, but what? I honestly don't think it is depression that he's experiencing right now or at least that's not the main cause of his laziness. He's young, he's got money, he has no schedule he has to stick too (other than YouTube uploads) he's got a friend/girlfriend that he wants to spend time with, I honestly just think he's living life and doing whatever he wants to do, he knows he can dip in and out of streaming whenever he wants to make a quick buck so why set himself a schedule and force himself to do things he doesn't want to?

He does really seem and sound genuine there. If she really is being honest, then good for her. One needs to be honest with oneself if one wishes to live comfortably and happily in one's own skin. And for a boy like finn, who's had a history of severe depression, honesty with himself will be as a torchlight. In that it crucially helps navigate and emerge from that dark cavernous hell that is depression. So major progress if she really was being honest there. 3450880 Anonymous 04 Dec 2021 16:03:09    >>23449139 Since he likes weapons so much, I'd take him to my local gun club.

Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3451349 Anonymous 04 Dec 2021 16:47:24   Also the hair will be cut 2-3 inches in that month.

Cutting his hair too short too suddenly might bring on a good deal of dysphoria. So if he decides to \"reverse\". then better to ease into it by just dressing manly during boi month, then when he's gotten used to looking somewhat manly, go ahead and shave it off. But of course, he shouldn't actually fucking cut his hair though. 3452621 Anonymous 04 Dec 2021 18:18:10    >>23451929 hes not even holding two glasses kek the “pink glasses” are a shadow 3452680 Anonymous 04 Dec 2021 18:21:57    >>23452405 It's an interesting theory. >>23452621 He has a pair in his other hand... 3452699 Anonymous 04 Dec 2021 18:23:30    >>23452621 The other pair of glasses are by his leg, right on the edge of the chair. 3452765 Anonymous 04 Dec 2021 18:29:01 324526.png   >>23452517 In the last stream he mentioned how he likes his long hair and wouldn't want to cut it even for boy mode. 3452790 Anonymous 04 Dec 2021 18:31:09    >>23452176 >finally beginning to realize that himself.

As obvious as that sounds, i don't think he's really internalized the fact. How can we help him accept the other 50% of himself that isn't \"man/manly\". 3453058 Schizo-poster 04 Dec 2021 18:52:58 798467.png   >>23452790 I don't think he's full gay, he probably likes girls too but he's too feminine and girly for them to really be interested in him back which in turn has forced him to experiment with the idea of liking guys, he started crossdressing and experimenting with these ideas at the perfect age for these thoughts to manifest into real feelings, I wouldn't be surprised if he has already started experimenting with men, or at least cock (Riza?) I believe that he'll come out publicly soon as a bisexual, I assume he has already came out to close family and maybe even his friends and is just waiting for the opportune time to come out to his fans. Let's face it he has enough lgbt friends and acquaintances that are also creators so he will know how coming out will affect his career and he's waiting until the right time for it to be worthwhile in terms of profitability. I hope Mariza can talk him into it sooner rather than later though.

But his gf did put makeup on him before then. So maybe the breakup had to do with her (the gf) getting spooked by finn's taking to the makeup and it flaring his girly side. Which may have been too much for the girl, causing her to look for \"masculinity\" elsewhere, and ended up cheating on our boy. Reminds me of that 2015 movie \"The Danish Girl\", where the guy's crossdressing lead him to experimenting with another guy. So perhaps something similar happened to our young couple here. But based on my observation, finn seems more reserved in his sexuality back then compared to now, which would make sense when considering that the possible effects of 'bullying' was still fresh, thus the repression likely was still high. So his experimentation may have only gone as far as kissing, leading to the breakup. 3462093 Anonymous 05 Dec 2021 06:10:06    >>23461894 it was 2 bed brought together, I had a similar situaton with a male friend and we brought the bed together because they were too small otherwise.

If irc, in the nostalgia stream where he cried after telling the story about him and his dad, he said that was a hard time for him, that he just cried and kept looking at the screen to try and block out the feelings (and 'bad' thoughts?). That the depression wasn't so much about the break up, but his overall depression welling again. He even went to the specific minecraft video wherein he did the crying, but i'm too lazy to look for it to pinpoint the date. Once we have the date of the video then we have the ballpark time of the break up with Eva Anyway, he then mentioned how he talked to Skeppy about \"all\" of it, practically poured his heart out to the guy. So if there was a dude he'd have experimented with, i think it'd be Skeppy, but i think Skeppy lived in the US at the time. So couldn't have been with him. There's also the friend that lives nearby his parents' house, but mentioned how he hadn't spoken to that friend in a long while during one of this walking streams, so couldn't be that friend either. This leaves the friend who he kissed in a truth or dare game, and who better to further experiment with, then the dude you kissed in a truth or dare game?  >>23461221 >said he wasn't good at kissing How interesting that he'd critique the quality of the kiss. Almost as if kissing a dude wasn't bizarre enough to quell trivial and secondary thoughts like \"this guy who i'm locking lips with isn't a very good kisser\".

I'm not gonna claim to have insider info on any of his mods but It's clear from Finn's streams that Stov is weirdly obsessive over Finn and these \"sub goals\" he's always seething about, I get it to a degree, Stov has donated a lot of money to see these things get done and Finn is basically scamming him (and everyone else). But the obsessiveness is more than just that, Stov's always lurking in his offline chat, They have a separate discord set up just so they can privately talk along with a few other high profile Finn enjoyers, He's just had Finn send him the key to his boy clothes box so he is kinda like Finn's master, imagine It was a chastity cage that Stov held the key to, weird right, well it's basically the same thing only less sexual (for Finn anyway, I'm sure this whole situation is extremely sexual and fetishized for Stov). there's a lot more to it and I'm sure some other anon's have a lot more info than me, I'm not gonna claim to be someone on the inside because I'm not, I just feel the need to call out weird predatory behaviour when I see it. >>23470062 >Can we be friends IRL?

It doesn't mean anything to Finn sure but I'm sure Stov is salivating at the thought of receiving that key, It's very real for him and that's what makes it weird, we can all see that this shit is just a meme and it means nothing but for some of his simps this is very real. >They all play a game with terms they understand, at least that's what I see, finn knows, the donators know and the viewers know the game.

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3407055 Anonymous 01 Dec 2021 11:19:01    >>23404465 >littleforbig onesie Wait a fuck, does this guy do diaper stuff? 3407066 Anonymous 01 Dec 2021 11:20:28    >>23407055 maybe read the thread It's not long 3407248 Schizo-poster 01 Dec 2021 11:49:58    >>23406625 This is definitely one of John's weird fantasies, what a fucking loser, I hope the rumours of him roping are true. 3407293 Anonymous 01 Dec 2021 11:56:15    >>23407248 Don't feed the bbc cuck poster. 3407353 john 01 Dec 2021 12:04:37    >>23407248 same 3407366 Anonymous 01 Dec 2021 12:06:27 Girlfriend Christmas14.jpg   >>23404465 >>23404491 >>23406625 you just know 3407441 Anonymous 01 Dec 2021 12:19:15    >>23406625 so this copypasta is gonna be there every thread now? 3407799 Anonymous 01 Dec 2021 13:07:18 E3CACA45-B94D-47C2-B1A3-81C0A744 (...).jpg   >>23407248 I thought you were dead 3407836 Anonymous 01 Dec 2021 13:12:17   HRTits are the best thing ever.

I disagree, he's presenting male in the photo, that isn't an accident, I think this is what he wants, interestingly this is the only male presenting photo he has ever posted to his Instagram and it has also got more likes than the majority recent girl photos, this is a huge deal for Finn, his audience wants him as a guy and I hope he takes note. 3384470 Anonymous 29 Nov 2021 22:16:50    >>23383851 >>23383864 Godamn weirdos pavloving him into beeing a guy baka 3384515 Anonymous 29 Nov 2021 22:20:25    >>23384400 Topless f1nn bro.

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3396141 Anonymous 30 Nov 2021 17:31:01    >>23396031 And you think he's attracted to men based on what?

I’m thinking he’ll do like short, in-stream goals, like “1k and I’ll tuck” and such. Idk how much he can actually do that though, since twitch is notoriously bitchy. Might end up with him moving to a cam site or something  > True, a stream with Pyro would be so good, any stream with Riza is automatically based and streams with his other friends are cool too. Idk why he hasn’t streamed with Pyro yet, maybe he (pyro) has been too busy? Didn’t he move? He should definitely be on soon though, it’s a perfect fit.

Let's continue the Finnspiracies and schizo posting. 3352887 Anonymous 27 Nov 2021 20:38:28    >>23352863 I often fantasize about Rose's first interaction with man. I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3352896 Anonymous 27 Nov 2021 20:39:08    >>23352863 Streaming is so tailored to women receiving donation from nerds that nerds on the platform now have to be \"women\" in order to get donations from other nerds.

He's obviously getting fucked by Riza, on account of how girly he was on stream. Not to mention, Rose was positively glowing there, like a woman who's been orgasming, likely right before they went to the German market or right before the stream. 3363857 Schizo-poster 28 Nov 2021 15:26:08 436780.png   >>23363722 >Rose was positively glowing there, like a woman who's been orgasming, likely right before they went to the German market or right before the stream.

If he isn’t straight, why would he lie about that? Being at least bi would help his brand tremendously, but if it’s not that, what else could it be. I definitely don’t think it’s gender, because when Riza put the estrogen cream on him, as a joke, she sounded genuinely kind of concerned, or at least the most serious she was the entire stream, when telling him to wipe it off.

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3336978 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 18:10:42 4B44E483-B677-4C12-AE3D-E54C7B48 (...).jpg   >>23336799 You again? 3337015 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 18:13:15 1607026147665.png   >>23336799 Take your blacked fantasy back to /pol/ where it belongs. 3337019 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 18:13:31    >>23336978 shut up faggot. >>23336799 based and hot. be more graphic and gross next time. 3337055 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 18:16:20    >>23336799   giwtwm 3337063 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 18:17:18    >>23329446 I feel like its kind of fucking retarded to say that someone is trans just cause they are cross dressing.

Yep, this bear ain't quite alright. I once was an okay bear, but then campers cavorted in MY part of the woods. Drinking, smoking, dancing, laughing. But that all stopped when they saw me lurking. Screaming, shrieking, tumbling, running. I sent them scattering like farts in the wind.  One left behind lying face down on the ground. Its scent was of cum, perfume, and shit. It smelled like their males but looked like their females. And there, between its legs. Peaking from under its skirt. There they were. Golden, pungent, brown nuggets. Now. Ever since. I try. I try my very best. My damndest. To be a good bear. A normal bear. The best bear i can be. To mind my business.  I forage for roots, fish, and fruits.

That would make even the straightest most cis male there is at least question their identity, I can't imagine what It's doing to someone as fragile as Finn, someone who has all but admitted to being bullied at school, almost exclusively hanging around with girls, growing up in an extremely liberal household, at this point I think It's only a matter of time before he comes out, he may have been forced into this or at least that's what he will tell himself to justify his feelings but I don't think even he can deny it for much longer, hopefully the time he spends with Riza over the next few days and Christmas will only strengthen his feelings, he can't keep on repressing forever, it must be killing him inside, I almost feel bad for him. tldr; Finn trans. 3339415 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 21:11:53   Damn this thread got more projectors than an iMax  It's ok to crossdress and not be trans anons 3339454 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 21:16:37    >>23328501 >>23329103 Unless you like 3339490 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 21:19:12    >>23339387 oh the dude inventing storylines about his princess is back 3339505 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 21:20:38    >>23339415 >It's ok to crossdress and not be trans anons Yes, but Finn's been forcefemmed by his paypigs for like a full year at this point.

All I'm saying is that he probably frequently questions his identity on a day to day basis, looks in the mirror and sees a girl even when in \"boy mode\". hangs around with trans and other lgbt people all the time. Is almost definitely (in my opinion, I know people get really triggered when I say this) in a relationship with a trans woman and denies that he's trans more than is reasonable for someone who claims to be \"just a crossdresser\". And as an aside he's not at all \"my princess\" I just find the whole situation with him fascinating and can't wait to see what the future holds for him, It's just a really interesting and somewhat unique position he finds himself in and It's streamed for the world to see, he's a perfect case study for psychologists who are interested in gender identity and that's interesting to me. 3339780 Anonymous 26 Nov 2021 21:44:39    >>23339652 >Is almost definitely (in my opinion, I know people get really triggered when I say this) in a relationship with a trans woman Yeah I’m mostly on board with you but this is definitely not right.

I'm talking about a real man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Maybe she's in a cute pink sissy outfit or a classy short New Years Eve type dress. Even in her highest heels the man still towers over her. The feminine mannerisms she displays will be naturally amplified by the presence of a male who unabashedly looks at her with lust. Nervously fixing her hair, adjusting her top and skirt, her manicured hands hanging limply as he slowly puts his hands on her waist. \"Wait I dont know...\" she weakly protests as he pulls her in for a soft kiss on the lips. She feels his massive member grind into her as the kiss grows more passionate. He pulls away and pats her heard lightly as he pushes her shoulders. She giggles nervously and shyly protests again, but as pulls it out she naturally opens her mouth. \"I've never done this before...\" she whispers. Her porcelain skin and long pink nails cast a stark contrast to the chocolate erection she's now holding. \"Don't worry I'll show you how to be a good girl,\" he says as he pushes her eager painted lips towards the tip. A below average tent starts to form in her skirt and she begins to explore him with her tongue and eventually take him in as deep as she can. He pushes her too deep she coughs and gags. Looking up to her man with watery eyes ,\"Im so sorry am I doing ok?\" He smirks and puts his hand on her dainty chin. \"You're doing perfect beautiful.\" He pulls her up for a kiss and grips the back of her thighs lifting her off the ground. Slowly he walks over to the bed and lays her on her back. Her panties are quickly pulled off as she feels fingers and a tongue exploring her virgin hole for the first time. Through her moans and ecstasy she suddenly feels a larger pressure prodding her. Instinctively lifts her legs up as her man positions himself for her deflowering. \"Be gentle.\" If the months of living as a girl didn't do she now knows she will never be a man again. 3312422 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 00:48:43    >>23312307 Different angles and makeup, wow 3312432 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 00:49:22    >>23312422 there's no makeup on in either picture 3312439 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 00:49:39    >>23312399 I'm not reading all that bro but good for you 3312485 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 00:52:07    >>23312432 he does have makeup on in the egirl pic, he ust use the \"less is more\" type of thing. 3312511 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 00:53:13    >>23312485 That's from the VR stream, he wasn't wearing any. 3312578 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 00:57:27    >>23312511 Yep, those eyelashes are completely natural 3312598 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 00:58:48    >>23312578 fake eyelashes are not makeup 3312616 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 01:00:02    >>23312598 They make him look more feminine though, why else would he get them 3312803 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 01:12:16   the only way he'll legitimately go on HRT is if he's able to realize how deep in denial he is. so far, that hasn't happened (much).  another barrier is he's very self-critical of his appearance without makeup, his profile, and his voice, which (for a person that is proud of their looks) causes a reflexive \"I can't transition because I won't pass\" response. the best hope to crack f1nn's armor-shielded egg is for riza to talk to him about it, he trusts her more than chat. he could easily pass on HRT, and FFS or cosmetic surgery if he wanted to. not to mention he's working with the best voice expert in the country. 3312869 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 01:16:33    >>23312399 gave me a boner. might have to post this in every thread now, if not you, I will 3312999 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 01:26:05    >>23312803 riza doesn't think f1nn is trans, she thought he'd be non-binary at best 3313348 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 01:48:16 1614079906611.png   >>23312999 I think he's just a crossdresser, though I believe he will probably come out as bi at some point, because he enjoys arousing his male audience a bit too much. 3313391 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 01:50:48    >>23312999 That’s what she said for the camera, in reality she’s probably on here shitposting about him being on hrt 3313593 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 02:03:30    >>23313391 >she’s probably on here shitposting about him being on hrt She definitely seems like the type to do that.

Unfortunately, I think she started repressing again during the break that followed. She seems to want to forget that time, probably because it makes her feel confused and uncomfortable, and also because she doesn’t want to be trans. She is though, and I think that time kinda proves it. 3319309 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 14:15:32    >>23319168 they are just weirdos obsessed with him that gave themselves this mission of alwys having a thread going.

She has a justifiable fear of hate crimes. I mean, she said it herself that there are some very religious people (muslims?) around, some of which would want to hurt her physically. Coupled with Rose's non-confrontational personality, you just know the bullies would become rabid when their victim fails to fight back. The only males around to protect her are...her father? And knowing how caring Rose is, she'd hate for her 60+ year old father to foot the bill of heroism. So she'll keep on repressing until she moves elsewhere. Either that, or the Spaniards (probably the medbro?) landed a couple of compliments, and being irl and in person, were hard hitting, and knocked the girl almost of her feet. Now they've all but worn off and she's regained her balance.

And now Rose is befriending Ella Hollywood, a femboy (former tranny) that dabbles in hardcore pornography. Unlike Riza, Ella seems less dominant than Riza, and since Rose seems to be instigating the interaction with Ella, maybe because Rose sees Ella as a less overwhelming first step into dating trans, which includes giving and receiving (especially receiving). There's also the femboy friendships, which could all just be strategic and business/clout related, but back in school she hung out more with her female friends then with her male friends. Now she's inching more towards having close friends who are a \"combination\" of the two sexes, i.e. femboys/trannies. Could be she's more comfortable around those who 'resemble a union of the sexes', precisely because she identifies as that 'union'. 3322053 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 18:41:22    >>23322003 Ok, now this is schizoposting 3322073 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 18:42:39    >>23322003 every guy in my high school that spent their time in female social circles either came out as gay, bi, or trans, or already were. add another tidbit to the pile of sus shit Finn has done 3322101 Anonymous 25 Nov 2021 18:44:53    >>23321993 >He's living life on easy mode and still screwing up.

I feel like Kyle maybe has something beyond his fame that has Rose so excited about interacting with him. If I had to make a way out there guess, I'd say Kyle is Rose's type and that type is based on some guy who was her first crush, probably sometime in her early teens. She might've not even realized that she was crushing on this guy but her hardcore repping attitude, being disinterested in dating and insistence on being a straight guy could be related. Anons have brought up their theories about Rose being bullied in school and it got me thinking. Maybe this guy was part of the group, maybe it wasn't even bullying but he simply said something homophobic and she went along with it to stay on his good side but at the same time it broke her heart. That's why she can't be into guys. Based on what she's told us her parents raised her to be very not-homophobic, so this internalized homophobia of hers must come from her social sphere outside of her family. And that's why the *right* guy for Rose will be the guy who will accept her, approach her and be that right guy archetype for her. 3296361 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 21:55:27    >>23296260 oh wow he is aging his skin so fast with all that makeup 3296388 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 21:58:18    >>23296319 Snurly 3296407 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 21:59:18    >>23296333 Who is Kyle?

Lots of extremely attractive and charismatic people end up stuck at 70-100 viewers and make no money.  The best business model is to build a following on Instagram/Twitter with slightly suggestive but ultimately wholesome photos. Slowly progress the lewdness of the photos but keep them PG-13. Get your followers desperate to see more.

It also fuels the force fem tendencies of the simps because F1nn resists at first and eventually gives in. In comparison \"out\" transgirl streamers aren't nearly as popular or successful. Though I think F1nn having his minecraft audience helped kickstart his streams because otherwise nobody would've been watching in the start. Starting out is the hard part because you need to conjure viewers from somewhere. So if you're gonna do it you should carefully observe what F1nn has done and not just the current streams but the origins. >>23273624 He makes content vs most other people doing the same thing are just posting some pics on insta.

She was right about the rats. You’d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn’t know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said “Ouch!” it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn’t let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband’s matters. But she broke off to say: “Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy.” So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says: “Come, now, what’s your real name?” “Wh—what, mum?” “What’s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?—or what is it?” I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to do. But I says: “Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I’m in the way here, I’ll—” 3286308 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 03:35:27   “No, you won’t. Set down and stay where you are. I ain’t going to hurt you, and I ain’t going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I’ll keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help you. So’ll my old man if you want him to. You see, you’re a runaway ’prentice, that’s all. It ain’t anything. There ain’t no harm in it. You’ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn’t tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that’s a good boy.” So I said it wouldn’t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn’t go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn’t stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen. “Goshen, child? This ain’t Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen’s ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?” “Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.” “He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.” “Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain’t no matter now. I got to be moving along. I’ll fetch Goshen before daylight.” “Hold on a minute. I’ll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.” 3286323 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 03:36:28   So she put me up a snack, and says: “Say, when a cow’s laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer up prompt now—don’t stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?” “The hind end, mum.” “Well, then, a horse?” “The for’rard end, mum.” “Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?” “North side.” “If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction?” “The whole fifteen, mum.” “Well, I reckon youhavelived in the country. I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. What’s your real name, now?” “George Peters, mum.” 3286336 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 03:37:29   “Well, try to remember it, George. Don’t forget and tell me it’s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s George Elexander when I catch you. And don’t go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don’t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t’other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road’s a rocky one, and your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.” 3286343 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 03:37:55    >>23286298 >>23286308 >>23286323 >>23286336 wtf? 3286365 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 03:40:04    >>23286343 the more these threads are made the more weirdos you bring to rose, if you sickos really want him to stay \"pure\" you'll probably make these less frequent.

You don't have to be an incel to see the shit going on nowadays.

You’re a child in all but age, barely completed your development of interpersonal relationships. Most people are sexually active, unlike you. Not everyone copes with the fact that they can’t get laid by saying that they’re “saving themselves for marriage.” Just admit you’re jealous of all the male attention that women get, either because you’re repressing homosexual urges or you lacked a father figure, idk which. Now, go jack off to your mommy porn that gives you a sense of companionship in your otherwise lonely, pathetic life. 3288520 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 07:40:51   Is she on wikifeet yet? 3288529 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 07:42:06    >>23287778 >2/2 In finn/rose's case, we have a boy who has pretty much made a parody of the whole macho manly man for about 2 years now -and counting.

A big fuck fest of swapping bodily fluids between neighbors, friends. and acquaintances. An empty husk of an existence where there's nothing higher or sacred to strive for.

You sound like someone who's been turned into a cuck, or is on their way to becoming one. Have you been hurt before by women? How many times have you been cheated on? Was it only once? Did it hurt a lot? Do you cope by telling yourself women are sexual active, and it's natural, so you should accept it? 3288774 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 08:21:45 BA40B0C4-C279-4584-AADD-0B2972A9 (...).jpg   >>23288748 And they say that English shouldn’t be taught in school. 3288870 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 08:37:02 AF4E75F0-525E-4115-8C87-C510D69C (...).jpg   >>23288748 >>23288774 Stfu retards 3288927 Anonymous 23 Nov 2021 08:43:23    >>23288629 Buddy, what fucked up idea of healthy sexuality do you have in that fucked up little head of yours?

I mean, look at this pic, that's a happy woman right there. 3265735 Anonymous 21 Nov 2021 19:11:27 1637322178366.jpg   >>23252984 >Don't mind me just culturally destroying your Femboys  3265775 Anonymous 21 Nov 2021 19:13:57    >>23265386 He says how much he misses streaming every time he comes back from a long break, and it’s just so sus 3265797 Anonymous 21 Nov 2021 19:15:38   bby girl going live 3265894 Anonymous 21 Nov 2021 19:25:58    >>23265775 Yeah, if it's so much fun to stream, then surely he wouldn't forget how much fun it is. Like when you haven't played your favorite game in a while and you get irked when life keeps you from diving back in. So if by day 4 or 5 of not streaming he'd've thought to himself \"gee, i'm bored right now, it would sure be neat to stream right now\". What else would stop him from streaming at that point, if not the weight of depression.

Anyone knows how much money he made per month before he started this egirl stuff? yeah that's possible. but: - i m o \"femboy\" can imply something slightly different. full on pink crossdressing stuff isn't exactly equivalent to \"femboy\". femboys are a bit more boyish and a bit less excessively \"womanly\" in the way he's presenting. femboys don't necessarily crossdress, for example, or if they do it's often in a more subtle and less ostentatious way. (though this is a pretty crude stereotype and a lot of femboys probably do wear dresses) - even if the original intention and current intention was to milk simps - and I'm sure that is one of the intentions, and possibly the only one - that's not necessarily mutually exclusive with liking it intrinsically, as well, or growing to like it intrinsically over time. especially as you start to appreciate the deluge of attention and doting in addition to the money - the mere act of putting yourself out there in the first place on a regular basis, interacting with everyone, expending all this time and effort, showing yourself off to people, etc. makes me think there's also something else to it at the very least, he's probably legitimately a \"real\" femboy/GNC, I think I'm a cis guy and have a naturally very femboyish/feminine appearance and have also occasionally considered doing something like this to make some side money. at least speaking for myself, there's no doubt in my mind that if I were to ever do that it would be both for the money and for the attention / influence / response / desirability 3243116 Anonymous 20 Nov 2021 03:03:10    >>23242723 >who are you people?

Been watching the streams for almost as long as he's been doing them. Been on the board for quite some time as well. Been on 4chan for ages. Most of the people posting here are a bunch of newfriends from when some idiot brought these threads up in reddit. If you ask me they can fuck off back to where they came from and take their creepy shit with them. I watch because I find it interesting and entertaining. It's sort of tranny adjacent content which there isn't that much of and I'm curious to see how far he will go. Will he end up transitioning because of the simps' pressuring and positive reinforcement? Will we find that he was repressing all along? Is it just a brilliant scheme to make money? It's a weird new form of youtube/streaming era entertainment. 3248369 Anonymous 20 Nov 2021 14:14:51    >>23245582 He wants to starve himself but his audience doesn’t know because they’re amerifags kek 3248408 Anonymous 20 Nov 2021 14:20:11    >>23248333 >Will he end up transitioning because of the simps' pressuring and positive reinforcement?

Probably wishful thinking, but one day he’s going to come out of these breaks with a coming out announcement, I guarantee it. 3208550 Anonymous 17 Nov 2021 23:15:51    >>23208490 >one day he’s going to come out of these breaks with a coming out announcement, I guarantee it.

Middle and early high school can be a bitch, the immaturity of teenagers wanting to be adults can make for some cruel interactions. If f1nn's female friends wanted to put makeup on him, then he was probably showing his girly side involuntarily. So quite likely there was some bullying at some stage. Kind of sad that the little guy might have gone through that shit, he seems like such a loving and kind person. 3185557 Anonymous 16 Nov 2021 08:40:16 1669iz.jpg   >>23184952 >hips Well what do you know, tranny tech is advancing at a decent pace, all thanks to the gooks. https: //  genderanalysis.net/2018/02/a-new-plastic-surgery-technique-for-hip-widening/ Hip plasty that's safe, easy, minimally invasive, and reversible.

Or maybe he's just a loyal kind of guy (tradwife), not interested in flings and casual sex. I think he mentioned once that he can't enjoy porn because there's no \"relationship\" or connection or intimacy, something along those lines.

The only time I ever fucked up was with this one girl where I built her up way too much in my own head. I wanted her so bad and that threw me off my natural rhythm. We talked a lot and were friendly, but it never moved beyond that because I had placed her too far above me in my own mind. Now I keep the mentality that no one is better than me, under any circumstance. I don't get arrogant about it, I just keep reminding myself that whoever I am going after is a person just like me. They probably have more insecurities than I do, more stress than I do, more emotional baggage than I do. I just tell myself that I am the funniest person in the room, the smartest in the room, the best looking in the room, and that confidence carries me through the small talk. Trying to flirt and joke around with Finn could be one of the scariest things in the world if I let it, but I don't. He's just another dude, albeit one that I find extremely attractive. Texting is seriously the easy part. Treat it like you were just messaging one of your best friends and it will come naturally. 3148798 Anonymous 13 Nov 2021 19:12:29   50 trannies have killed themselves since this thread was posted 3148906 Anonymous 13 Nov 2021 19:23:48    >>23148728 Yeah, that's adorable.

We can model straightness using the function f(x)=1/x, where x indicates exactly how straight one is, and f(x) indicates their attraction to men. If f(x) were to equal zero, then that person would be entirely homosexual. What we need to do is take the limit of that function as x approaches infinity. Doing that, we that that as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches 0. At some level, people are likely so straight that they’d never even think about a man, but not 100% straight. Likewise no one is 100% gay. There’s probably always someone who happens to be of the same gender that someone, as a straight male, would be attracted to, but when the straightness goes high enough, it doesn’t matter and is indistinguishable from 100% straight.

You can’t really have a 100% of infinity, and that’s what 1/x approaches as x approaches zero.

He's just a crossdresser for money. Unofficially it seems pretty clear that he's doing this because he likes looking like a woman. In fact he is currently on a diet and exercise program with the goals of losing weight and gaining hips and ass. Girl month is a monthly donation goal that was originally devised by the simp council to keep him wearing feminine things all month long, even when he is not on stream.

You can see the new box he just recently got for them in this clip. He bought a new lock for the box and he is mailing the keys to Stovamor (one of his stream mods) and someone else I don't remember.

He can't show it on stream? So why do they want him to do it? As someone else said above the council wants Finn to be their pretty princess that they can use for playing dress-up. Just watch on stream how they react when Finn asks chat about some clothes or makeup and chat chooses something that these coucil pricks didn't want. 2981931 Anonymous 01 Nov 2021 20:36:25    >>22981823 Honestly nothing against finn for taking their money but it is a little weird how blatantly fetishistic it is.

There can also be studies done on how internet influence can steer people. One day it'll become widely accepted that everything is basically a choice and your life hands you certain circumstances. Of course your free will (choices) will still end up deciding what it is that happens in your life June actively looks to receive attention for his looks because it is financially lucrative. In turn this at least means that he enjoys looking girly sometimes, so far he even calls himself a cross dresser. As if this was some sort of lifestyle, which it can be, however most cross dressers in recent times since becoming more commonly accepted, have claimed to be some form of LGBT. In fact, I have never met a straight cis cross dresser, term cross dresser implying they enjoy it and do it, maybe a couple times a week.  However, would June have decided to go as far as he has without the money? Is June actually secretly kind of upset that this is his life now, and even though he makes money, wishes it could have been different? Since on stream all things LGBT are denied, and yet some acts are admitted to, was June always like this and would have ended up eventually coming out as some form of LGBT? Personally, I think June has always known they want to be trans, or better said wishes they were AFAB, also lifestyle choices like veganism surely also pushed this as well, and our modern society that basically attacks testosterone in a myriad of different ways. However they wanted a way to validate themselves and upon finding out they looked good in make up and such as a kid at school, they decided to go through with cross dressing, of course puberty having an effect in that now June wants to or expresses wanting to be a manly man, that the main thing with HRT that he dislikes is the effects of fertility. Of course, sperm can be frozen and with enough money/time, June will be trans or at least non binary on HRT. 2931573 Anonymous 29 Oct 2021 01:50:37    >>22931549 take your meds 2931888 Anonymous 29 Oct 2021 02:16:36    >>22930069 wtf cute as fuck 2932057 Anonymous 29 Oct 2021 02:29:25 685367863.webm   >>22931224 who cares if he sees this thread. he's probably into this anyway also, hi john, hope you're doing well  >>22931379 >chaser.jpg yeah Kyle got real horny 2932181 The Yuri King 29 Oct 2021 02:38:47 1444404468848.jpg   >>22927408 I'm AFAB and Finn is my ideal straight man.

The context within which you have sex with a man would need to be determined, like it couldn't be romantic or sensual, but prison gay or asserting dominance through rape isn't gay. However even crossdressing to save your life is looked down upon as incredibly homosexual. 2933164 Anonymous 29 Oct 2021 04:01:22    >>22931379 I wonder what Wings would think of F1nn 2933256 Anonymous 29 Oct 2021 04:09:41 1627893865802.jpg   >>22932181 I'm sure you can find them on every dating app. You can even say that's what you're looking for on your profile and some people will likely admit they'd do that. >>22933143 It seems to depend on the situation.

In practice no, that's generally not how people act or judge each other. Still there's probably nothing stopping you. Straight men can be kinky, submissive, crossdress, tease bisexuality, and really love and be attracted to women exclusively. 2861244 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 05:03:41 1612340184454.jpg   >>22860292 If the guy looks like this, then I'm still gonna call myself straight. 2862740 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 08:41:38    >>22860292 Queer heterosexuality It's a thing just look it up. 2864427 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 12:56:27    >>22861244 lol 2864633 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 13:16:05    >>22860292 it is a weak trait not to be able to adapt to any condition. conditions like - an attractive person's genitalia. 2864980 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 13:55:31    >>22864633 lol you seem brainwashed. 2865875 swiftiehon!!ugVYLkrV8bR 24 Oct 2021 15:32:12    >>22860292 its okay to dress up and like girls 2866098 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 15:54:34    >>22860292 you don't even lose \"straight points\" for sucking cock anymore hell getting fucked in the ass isn't even that gay unless you keep doing it. and pegging is straight, apparently, even though it's gayer than gay sex who the fuck makes these rules here why does nothing make sense I guess you're gay if you really like it? or if you're consistently gay? if you think or say \"wow I want to fuck one of these men\" unironically. what the fuck is irony???  literally one of my gym bros tried to hold my hands and called them soft and I'm a non-HRT repressor 2866202 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 16:03:54    >>22866098 it used to be so plain and simple!!!! if you like someone who has a cock its gay!!!! and if it looks like a bloke its gay!!! nothing makes sense anymore??? how can we keep making up exceptions and excuses like this!! i would ravage a pure submissive femboy (in a manly way) 2866203 Anonymous 24 Oct 2021 16:03:58 neither_can_lose_by_cpericardium (...).jpg   >>22866098 >literally one of my gym bros tried to hold my hands and called them soft and I'm a non-HRT repressor OH GOD I WISH THAT WAS ME t.

Whatever you define them to be.

If it doesn't involve sex with any non-woman and you are a man then you are a straight dude still. Unless you don't want to be. Like, maybe you have fantasies about men but don't act on them? You don't have to have gay sex to be gay. And you could have gay sex to try it and not enjoy it because you're straight. >Do you lose straight points if you crossdress but never touch another man? No? Not unless by crossdress you mean mentally, socially, legally, or biologically transform yourself into a woman by changing your legal name and sex, passing, taking estradiol, etc. In which case you wouldn't be a straight dude anymore. But straight dudes are allowed to cross-dress it doesn't make you any less straight.

I'd rather die kicking and screaming than be forced to have sex with a non op FtM, but I would readily have sex with an attractive non op MtF.

It doesn’t make the ones who r straight gay, it doesn’t make any of them trans. They’re not eggs either, they’re happy, well adjusted individuals who are comfortable with their bodies.  Shit, even I like crossdressing sometimes still. I’ll do it, take cute pics, jack off and then take off the fake boobs and corset. It’s fun and it satisfies my AGP (the actual kink, not whatever weird blanchardian dysphoria shit this board comes up with). I’ve never felt more comfortable with myself since I started living as a guy full time, the occasional cross dressing honestly feels more fun as a hobby than as something I did every mf day.

Either f1nn is a gigabrain tranner who's funding her transition through twitch simps by playing into the femboy hype instead of acknowledging that she's trans. Or he's just a normal attention addicted zoomer who got conditioned to enjoy this because simps keep rewarding him for doing it. 2068495 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 02:11:56    >>22068483 I don’t have the screenshot or use Twitter but someone posted it she flat out said she fucks him in the ass in a tweet 2068527 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 02:15:53    >>22068495 >people can't joke on twitter You clearly don't understand what kind of person Meowriza is or what kind of dynamic their friendship has.

He honestly seems like he doesn't like her at all whenever we see them on stream together.

Doesn't know how to socialize without insulting someone, likely to distract from his own insecurities. F1nn is honestly a huge push over and it doesn't seem like he knows how to tell someone that aggressive to go away. 2070458 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 05:37:07    >>22070404 Well yeah but it's not like he'd be poor without the simp money. IIRC he said in a past stream that twitch was like 30% of his income or something like that. Though that might've changed now that he's gotten like 70k just in donations in the last couple months. We know the smartphone generation is an attention addicted bunch. He clearly enjoys it. Whether that is in part due to AGP or the stream conditioned it into him idk. 2072067 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 10:58:21 lgbt-46.jpg  They mentioned it multiple times 2072167 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 11:26:07    >>22072067 >\"I met my \"soon to be\" best friend...\"  2072264 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 11:49:12    >>22067874 Here come the shills like clockwork. 2072303 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 12:00:47    >>22072167 cough >soulmate  cough 2072335 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 12:10:37    >>22067874 >tfw no transbian rapehon to force me into sex  it's not fair 2072462 Anonymous 26 Aug 2021 12:37:08    >>22072067 >>22072167 >>22072303 and as always, 4chaners miss that meowriza fucks around constantly saying this shit while on the other side finn's say all the time he is single and not looking for someone.
